Scratch
Itâ€™s time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch, at scratch.mit.edu, any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.

Solution:
I have created a Monkey and Banana game. 
When the game starts, the Monkey is standing still, and the bananas are randomly moving around the screen. 
There is a score and a timer at the top of the screen. 
The score starts at zero and increments as the Monkey touches the banana, and the user selects the [SPACE] key.
A timer starts at 30 and decreases as the banana touch the edge/walls. But, also increases by one when the above even happens.
A user must use the UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys to control the monkey.
Once the timer reaches 0, the Game is Over.
